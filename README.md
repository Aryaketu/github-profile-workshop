# Steps
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
1. Click your profile picture (top right corner) > Your Profile
    * In the left sidebar tap "Edit profile" and set: 1) profile picture 2) About me 3) other data like links to social profiles
1. In the top right toolbar: click "+" > "New repository". Enter the following data:
    * Repository name: **exactly** the same name as your GitHub username.
    * Initialize this repository with: check "Add a README file"
    * Leave all others to default and press "Create repository".
1. Edit your profile `README.md` in your new repo `https://github.com/your_username/your_username`
    * Click the :pencil2: icon on the `README.md` below the file list to start editing the file right in your browser.
        * Remember to publish your edits form time to time by pressing the "Commit changes" button in the top right corner.
    * Start with template below. Copy it to your `README.md`.
    * Use this Markdown syntax [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
    * Make good use of [emojis](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet)
        e.g. `:computer:` -> :computer:
    * Add some badges to show your preferences:
        * https://home.aveek.io/GitHub-Profile-Badges/
        * https://github.com/alexandresanlim/Badges4-README.md-Profile
    * Maybe you want to generate your own Octocat (GitHub logo animal) that represents you.
        * Generate at https://myoctocat.com/
        * Download the result and upload it to your profile repo in the browser. Go to your profile and locate the "Add file" button" above the file list.
        * Insert the image in your README.md with something like `![My Octocat](my_octocat.png)`.
1. When done: make sure to run your text though a [spell checker](https://languagetool.org/). Paste in your whole markdown text.
